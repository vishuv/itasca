Overview :
----------

The scripts runit-generic.sh and generic.pbs are examplse of how to 
run jobs on itasca using the pbs queue. You will need to modify these
scripts as described below before submitting them. When you are ready
to run, just run runit-generic.sh as a bash script. 

chomd gou+x runit-generic.sh
./runit-generic.sh

This will submit generic.pbs to the pbs queue. You can then watch your 
script progress through the queue via the qstat command. 

qstat -u $USER

runit-generic.sh will compile your Hadoop program and then submit 
generic.pbs to the pbs queue in order to run that program. 

generic.pbs will copy your input data from /lustre/$USER to HDFS (local 
/scratch space on each node). Make certain to request enough nodes to give 
you enough disk space (remembering that each node has 85 GB of scratch 
space). Once the data is copied your Hadoop program will be run, and
output will be written to both generic.o and /lustre/$USER/myoutput

Details : 
---------

Before submitting runit-generic.pbs You need to copy your .java program 
to the directory where these scripts reside, and you need to copy your 
input data to a directory in /lustre/$USER. You will then need to modify 
these scripts to use your program and data. 

generic.pbs will write out log and error files to your $HOME directory 
(these files end with *EU and *OU). These only exist during the life of 
your job, and you can view those to monitor the progress of your job. 
Once your job ends these become generic.o and generic.e. Also note that 
a hadoop directory will be kept in your $HOME directory (named as   
hadoop.jobid.node.localdomain/) - this contains a great deal of log 
information that can be useful in debugging. These are permament files 
that you may want to delete from time to time (but do not delete while a 
job is running). 

You need to modify the following environment variables in generic.pbs :

CLASSNAME
LOCALINPUT

and you need to modify the following in runit-generic.pbs :

CLASSNAME

Finally, and this is very important, you will need to include the 
following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file.

export JAVA_HOME=/soft/java/jdk1.6.0_23
